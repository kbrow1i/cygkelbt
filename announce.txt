The following package has been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* kelbt-0.16-1

Kelbt generates backtracking LALR(1) parsers.  Where traditional
LALR(1) parser generators require static resolution of shift/reduce
conflicts, Kelbt generates parsers that handle conflicts by
backtracking at runtime.  Kelbt is able to generate a parser for any
context-free grammar that is free of hidden left recursion.

This is a new package in the Cygwin distribution.
